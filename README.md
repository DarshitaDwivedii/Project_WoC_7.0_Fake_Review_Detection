## 🧭 **About the Project**
This project is part of the Winter of Code (WoC) initiative by DA-IICT, a collaborative program designed to encourage students to explore and contribute to innovative projects. The objective is to provide a hands-on experience with real-world challenges in technology.

In the era of online shopping, reviews play a significant role in influencing consumer behavior. However, the rise of **fake reviews** poses a critical challenge to the authenticity of online feedback. This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to identify and flag fake reviews, ensuring **transparency** and **trust** for both consumers and businesses.
